# esp-flatcc

flatcc component for ESP32 (esp-idf) implements the runtime part of the flatcc C library on ESP-IDF

## Usage

1. Clone or submodule this repo to `components/flatcc` in your ESP-IDF project.
2. Separately build `flatcc` for your host architecture and generate with it the headers starting from your `.fbs` file.
3. Add the headers in your ESP-IDF project (ie. under `generated/`)
4. Build and enjoy flatbuffers!

# Note

Due to how code is generated by `flatcc` you will get warnings (which usually are then treated as errors)
from the compiler. You can override this by allowing certain warnings on the files where you are using
the `flatcc` generated code by putting in your `CMakeLists.txt` something like:

```
set_source_files_properties( myfileusingflatcc.c PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "-Wno-misleading-indentation" )
```

## TODO

- Fully integrate also compiler into system (so fully integrate step 2 in Usage list)
